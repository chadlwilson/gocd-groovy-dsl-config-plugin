# Automatically create and build pipelines for pull requests

Supports enumerating/scanning `git` refs from:

* GitHub PRs
* GitLab MRs (cloud and self-hosted)
* Bitbucket (formerly Bitbucket Cloud)
* Self-hosted Bitbucket
* Git branches (plain, vanilla `git`)

Look through the example scripts for basic usage as well as concrete examples of various utility methods and build notification configurations.
